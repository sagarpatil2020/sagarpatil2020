<p>
I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer with hands-on industry experience, comfortable working across frontend, backend, and deployments.
I focus on writing clean code, collaborating effectively with teams, and improving steadily over time.
I prefer solving real problems in a simple and practical way rather than over-engineering solutions.
